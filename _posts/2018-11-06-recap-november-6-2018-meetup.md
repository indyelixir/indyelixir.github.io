A big thanks to the folks who made it to our November meetup! If you couldnâ€™t make it in person, you can find recordings of most of our events on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

And thank you as always to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. For the first time, all our attendees had already won books, so no raffle this time, but remember you can always use our groupâ€™s discount codeâ€”`ug367`â€”on [manning.com](https://www.manning.com/) for 36% off their books on Elixir and other topics.

Kicking off our open-mic night, **Steve Grossi** walked through a recent upgrade from Phoenix 1.3 to the [just-released 1.4](https://phoenixframework.org/blog/phoenix-1-4-0-released) with support for HTTP2, webpack, and more. He also walked through formatting code with Elixir 1.6â€™s `mix format` task and some of its preferences:

- [stevegrossi/habits - Upgrade to Phoenix 1.4 ðŸŽ‰](https://github.com/stevegrossi/habits/pull/29)
- [stevegrossi/habits - Run the Elixir formatter on the codebase](https://github.com/stevegrossi/habits/pull/31)

After some discussion, we wrapped up the evening collaborating on an [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) exercise: **calculating the Nth prime number** in the series. Check out our solution below: thereâ€™s room for improvement in both performance and elegance, so feedback welcome!

Our next event will be on Tuesday, [January 8, 2019](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/events/256370894/) Weâ€™re always looking for speakersâ€”please [reach out](mailto:hello@indyelixir.org) if youâ€™re interested!

And if you just canâ€™t wait until January to hang out and talk tech, you can still sign up for the IndyHackers Holiday Social on December 1: [get your (free!) ticket here](http://www.indyhackers.org/holiday-social-2018).
