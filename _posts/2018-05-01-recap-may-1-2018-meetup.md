Thanks to all the folks who joined us on Tuesday! If you couldn’t make it, look for recordings soon on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

A big thank-you to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And congrats to Jared, Phil, and Travis, winners of Manning Publications’ *Elixir In Action*, *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*, and the upcoming *Phoenix In Action*.

We started the evening off with an open-mic night. **Eric Oestrich** shared an exciting update to his ex_venture project: it now supports running on multiple nodes for improved uptime and scalability.

We continued the meetup by mob-programming an **Exercism.io** exercise in Elixir. [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) is a platform that lets you collaborate and seek feedback on coding exercises in various languages. We had some great discussion, helpful to newcomers and experienced Elixirists alike!
