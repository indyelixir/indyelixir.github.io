Thanks to all who came out for Tuesdayâ€™s meetup! If you couldnâ€™t make it, look for recordings soon on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

Thanks as always to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And congrats to Eric and Mack, winners of Manning Publicationsâ€™ excellent Elixir books *Elixir In Action* and *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*.

## The Talks

**Eric Oestrich** gave an introduction to GenServer, a common building-block of OTP applications. He also delved into Elixir releases with [distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery) and showed an impressive demo of hot code swapping.
