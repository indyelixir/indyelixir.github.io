Thanks to all who made it to our September meetup! If you couldn’t make it in person, you can find recordings of most talks on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

Thank you as always to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And congrats to Carl, Conlin, and David, winners of Manning Publications’ *Elixir In Action*, *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*, and the upcoming *Phoenix In Action*.

Eric Oestrich previewed a talk [he later delivered at ElixirConf US 2018](https://elixirconf.com/2018/speakers/eric-oestrich), “Going Multi-Node,” on scaling an online multi-user dungeon game across multiple servers for enhanced performance and reliability:
