Thanks, everyone who joined us for Tuesday’s game-themed Indy Elixir! If you missed it, you can find recordings of past talks on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

Thanks as always to [our awesome sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And congrats to Chris and Brian, winners of Manning Publications’ excellent books *Elixir In Action* and *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*.

## The Talks

**Lucas Falk** started things off by demoing and walking us through a [websocket-based app he built](https://planning.falk.pw/) for agile planning poker. Using Phoenix channels for communication and a GenServer to hold game state, the app also has a great test suite and illustrates how to test these components of a real-time system.

**Ryder Timberlake** shared his work on an Elixir port of “Give Me Your Lunch Money,” an interactive fiction adventure game [originally built](http://www.adrift.co/game/1197) with the Adrift toolkit and for which he composed the soundtrack. He covered loading static data into Elixir from YAML and handling user input from a game command prompt. Ryder fielded questions but also came with some of his own—including why you would build this in Elixir in the first place—leading to some great discussion.
