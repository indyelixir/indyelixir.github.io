Happy New Year! Thanks to everyone who joined us for our first meetup of 2019. If you couldn’t make it in person, you can find recordings of most of our events on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

A big thank you to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) for their continued support in making Indy Elixir possible. Congrats to Andrew, Chris, and Michael, winners of Manning Publications’ *Elixir In Action*, *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*, and *Phoenix In Action*. Remember you can always use our group’s discount code—`ug367`—on [manning.com](https://www.manning.com/) for 36% off their books on Elixir and other topics.

**Ryan Billingsley** shared how [Clustertruck](https://www.clustertruck.com/) uses Elixir to power their new Clustertruck for Teams Slack integration. He covered the architecture of a Slack integration, declaring business logic with the [Opus](https://github.com/zorbash/opus) library, and complications with Slack deprecating a core API.

**Eric Oestrich** delved into websockets, particularly how his [Gossip](https://github.com/oestrich/gossip) game chat network and [Grapevine](https://github.com/oestrich/grapevine) player portal power cross-game communication across a network of games running on the [ExVenture](https://github.com/oestrich/ex_venture) framework.
