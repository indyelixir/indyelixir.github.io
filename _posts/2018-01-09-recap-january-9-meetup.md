Thanks to everyone who came out to kick off 2018 with Elixir! If you couldn’t make it, look for recordings soon on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

A big thank-you to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And congrats to Jake and Josh, winners of Manning Publications’ excellent Elixir books *Elixir In Action* and *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*. Check out Manning’s new Elixir book in development, [*Phoenix in Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/phoenix-in-action).

**Steve Grossi** gave the evening’s talk about “context” modules, a code organization pattern recently introduced in Phoenix 1.3. Contexts are simple to use and bring a number of benefits, but require thinking about your code in a slightly different way.

Our next event in the new year will be on Tuesday, [March 6, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/events/246743287/) We’re looking for speakers—please [let me know](mailto:hello@indyelixir.org) if you’re interested!
