We’ve been on a bit of a break, but everyone being stuck as home was just the nudge we needed to get back together for a remote meetup!

Thank you to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) for making tonight’s meetup possible. And congrats to David, Kevin, and Nathan, winners of Manning Publications’ *The Little Elixir &amp; OTP Guidebook*, *Elixir In Action*, and *Phoenix In Action*. As a reminder, you can use our group’s discount code—`ug367`—on [manning.com](https://www.manning.com/) for 36% off their books on Elixir and other topics.

**Mitchell Hanberg** returned to walk us through setting up automatuc deployments for Elixir applications using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), the [Gigalixir](https://www.gigalixir.com/) hosting platform, and his own [gigalixir-action](https://github.com/mhanberg/gigalixir-action). Watch the talk below or follow along with [the companion blog post](https://www.mitchellhanberg.com/ci-cd-with-phoenix-github-actions-and-gigalixir/).
