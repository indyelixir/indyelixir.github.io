This was our largest meetup yet! Over 20 of you came out to hear about using Elixir in production. If you couldn’t make it, look for recordings soon on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

A big thanks to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) who made tonight possible. And Congrats to Christopher and Miguel, winners of Manning Publications’ excellent books *Elixir In Action* and *The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook*.

## The Talks

**Brian Howenstein** talked about how [Clustertruck](https://clustertruck.com/) uses Elixir to cook, track, and deliver fresh food as quickly as possible. Brian delved into how Clustertruck introduced Elixir into their primarily-Rails stack.

- [Kitto](https://github.com/kittoframework/kitto), a small framework for creating dashboards in Elixir and React

**Jeff Browning** shared how his team uses Elixir to power [Yala](https://yalabot.com/), an intelligent chatbot that helps you manage, schedule, and optimize your team’s social posts. Jeff talked about some important pitfalls when running Elixir in production, as well as the benefits.

Our next event will be on Tuesday, [September 5, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/events/241639349/) We’re looking for speakers—please [let me know](mailto:hello@indyelixir.org) if you’re interested!
