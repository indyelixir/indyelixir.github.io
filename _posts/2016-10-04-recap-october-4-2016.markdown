Thanks to everyone who joined us for our second in-person meetup. Special thanks to David Jones for recording the talks: see the videos below and on our Youtube channel, [youtube.com/indyelixirorg](https://www.youtube.com/indyelixirorg).

Thanks again to [Lessonly](http://www.lessonly.com) for providing the space and to [Expected Behavior](http://www.expectedbehavior.com/) for the pizza and drinks. And I’m pleased to thank our newest sponsor, [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/), who let us give away copies of their two excellent Elixir books. Congrats to Andrew and Nathan who won copies of [*Elixir in Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action) and [*The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook*](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook), respectively. If you’d like your own copy of either (or any book from Manning’s large collection), they’ve kindly given us a 36% off discount code: `ug367`. I used it myself!

Finally, thanks to [Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/) we now have a Flowdock channel. [Click here to join](https://www.flowdock.com/invitations/95b9dce6c4946f9940ee17df43c27d06c0da5615), where we’ve been talking about the recent ElixirConf talks, asking questions, and solving problems with Elixir.

## Talks

**Miles Sterrett** came through in a pinch and talked about his experience porting the [Indy Hackers Job Board](http://www.indyhackers.org/jobs) over to Elixir and Phoenix. He focused on some interesting authentication requirements and how to use plug to achieve them.

- [The PR (feedback welcome!)](https://github.com/indyhackers/elixir-job-board/pull/8)

**Scott Johnson** gave a great introduction to the powerful automated provisioning framework [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and showed how to use it to set up any number of local or remote machines with Elixir and its dependencies. Scott’s posted the [slides on his blog here](https://fuzzygroup.github.io/blog/ansible/2016/10/04/ansible-basics-presentation-at-indy-elixir-meetup.html).
