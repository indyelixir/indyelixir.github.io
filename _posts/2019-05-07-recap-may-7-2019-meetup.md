Thanks as always to [our sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/indyelixir/sponsors/) for making tonight’s meetup possible. And congrats to Waseem and Garrett, winners of Manning Publications’ action-packed *Elixir In Action* and *Phoenix In Action*. As a reminder, you can use our group’s discount code—`ug367`—on [manning.com](https://www.manning.com/) for 36% off their books on Elixir and other topics.

This evening's talks focused on [Phoenix LiveView](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript), a new library from the Phoenix team that lets you build rich, interactive user interfaces without custom JavaScipt.

**Mitch Hanberg** started us off with a talk about refactoring an interface component from JavaScript/AJAX to LiveView to enable real-time updates. The end result required less code and was easier to reason about, too!

**Eric Oestrich** shared how he used both LiveView and Phoenix Channels to create a live-updating "Player Count" widget on [grapevine.haus](https://grapevine.haus/) that updates all connected clients when the count changes. Check out his [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TXVIkG6PF0) to watch Eric build it.

Finally, we had some great discussion after the talks. Mitch shared some current work on [an HTML DSL in Elixir](https://github.com/mhanberg/dsl). He came with a question for the group, but taught many of us a lesson in metaprogramming as we talked through it.
